# Distortion-phenomena-on-transmission-lines-using-corona-modeling-ATP-EMTP
The influence of corona on the propagation of transient voltages on transmission lines can be studied by modeling the impulse corona discharge, taking into account its physical properties. The technique of corona characteristics (charge-voltage) is more favorable than the propagation delay characteristic which is known to be less accurate and leads to results that are far from reality. In this paper, a mathematical model of corona discharge is integrated into the Alternative Transients Program of the ElectroMagnetic Transients Program software (ATP/EMTP), using the MODELS interface. The attenuation and distortion phenomena on the overhead transmission line caused by corona is modeled and simulated by the implementation of a corona model with the user-defined multi-branch type-94 circuit in ATP. Comparison between the computed results and literature experimental investigations gives a good agreement between them.
